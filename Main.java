/*Java Variable Types
You have 5 types of VARIABLES IN Java
Boolean: True/False, only 2 states - boolean
Intergers: Int , always WHOLE numbers
Strings: Text , ex "Hello"
Floats: Decimals, ex "19.999"
Char: Single characters, ex "A", "B", WRITE A CODE THAT GIVES YOU HOW MANY CHARACTERS ARE IN "Pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis"


In math x = 4 means 4 = x
In programming x = 4 {4 is assigned to x}

x = "Patty"
b = "Tomato"
c = "Cheese"
d = "Bread"
e = "Lettuce"
T = "Ketchup"
g = "Mayo"

So the template is: type variable = value;
